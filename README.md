## Files Involved

### 1. **FeedbackServlet.java** 
   - Located in `src/main/java/com/packages/FeedbackServlet.java`
   - This Servlet handles the submission of user feedback from the HTML form. It processes the form data and interacts with the database to store the feedback.

### 2. **DBConnection.java**
   - Located in `src/main/java/com/packages/DBConnection.java`
   - This class manages the database connection. It establishes and handles the connection to the database where feedback is stored.

### 3. **web.xml**
   - Located in `WEB-INF/web.xml`
   - The deployment descriptor file, which configures the servlet and its mappings to URL patterns.

## How to Run

1. **Build the Project**:
   - Compile the project in your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
   
2. **Deploy to a Servlet Container**:
   - Deploy the project to a servlet container like **Apache Tomcat**.

3. **Access the Application**:
   - Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/User_feedback` to interact with the feedback system.

## Technologies Used

- **Java** (Servlets)
- **HTML**
- **JSP** (Java Server Pages)
- **Database** (for feedback storage)

## Future Improvements

- Add validation for user input (e.g., email format check).
- Improve UI/UX design.
- Implement security features like input sanitization to prevent SQL injection.
